# Windows PowerShell Profile

A more functional PowerShell profile that enhances its capabilities to match a Linux terminal, while also including a backup mechanism for apps installed via Winget.

## PowerShell profile setup

Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

```powershell
irm "https://github.com/willychen0146/powershell-profile/raw/main/script/setup.ps1" | iex
```
   
## Backup and Restore Installed Apps using Winget

### Backup
This will generate a `json` file that stores all currently installed apps.

```
./data/ExportInstalledApps.ps1
```

### Restore Installed Apps
This will read the `json` file generated by the `ExportInstalledApps.ps1` and reinstall the apps.

```
./data/InstallAppsFromJson.ps1
```

### TODO
- [ ] Ignore some system apps when doing backup
- [ ] Add more functionality to the Profile
